The data has three parts: the first part is a sample of Uber rides from 01-2009 through 06-2015, the second part is Yellow Taxi trip data from 01-2009 through 06-2015 can be downloaded from [here](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page), and the third part is Historical weather data from 01-2009 through 06-2015 can be downloaded from [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/search/data-search/local-climatological-data?stations=72505394728).

## Installation
